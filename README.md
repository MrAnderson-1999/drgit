## Documentation automation for everyone

### Documentation Comments Generator
This repository contains a Python script that can be used to add documentation comments to a whole GitHub repository. The script uses the ChimeraGPT API to generate the documentation comments.

### Features
- Adds documentation comments to all the lines of code in a repository.
- Uses the ChimeraGPT API to generate documentation comments that are specific to the code they are commenting on.
- Easy to use: just pass the repository URL to the script, and it will do the rest.

### Requirements
- Python 3
- ChimeraGPT API

### Installation
`pip install chimeragpt-api`

### Usage
`python main.py https://github.com/<username>/<repo>`
This will add documentation comments to all the files in the repository. You can then push the changes to the repository to make the documentation available to others.

Example
-
The following is an example of the output of the script:
```
/* (Automated GPT comment): Includes the system header for ioctl. */
#include <sys/ioctl.h>

/* (Automated GPT comment): Includes the vdrm_ioctl header. */
#include "vdrm_ioctl.h"

/* (Automated GPT comment): Defines the buffer size. */
#define BUFFER_SIZE 16384+sizeof(struct ioctl_data) //2^14

/* (Automated GPT comment): The path to the vtux device. */
const char path[] = "/dev/vtux";

int main() {
	/* (Automated GPT comment): Opens the vtux device. */
	int fd = open(path, O_RDWR);
	if (fd < 0) {
		/* (Automated GPT comment): Failed to open the vtux device. */
		printf("failed to open vtux controller, what: %s\n", strerror(-fd));
		return fd;
	}

	/* (Automated GPT comment): Allocates a buffer for the ioctl data. */
	char buf[BUFFER_SIZE];

	/* (Automated GPT comment): Clears the buffer. */
	memset(buf, 0, BUFFER_SIZE);

	/* (Automated GPT comment): Casts the buffer to a struct ioctl_data pointer. */
	struct ioctl_data *ioctl = (struct ioctl_data*) buf;

	/* (Automated GPT comment): A loop that reads from the vtux device until the end of file. */
	ssize_t byteRead = 0;

```
As you can see, the script adds documentation comments to all the lines of code that do not already have comments. The documentation comments are generated by the ChimeraGPT API and are specific to the code they are commenting on.
